Question 1. What are the decryption key(s)?
            Represent all binary data as hex strings.

Question 2: Are the keys above symmetric or asymmetric? What type of keys are
            they (e.g. RSA)?

The key above here is asymmetric - there is a 

Question 3. Describe the reverse engineering methods by which you discovered the
            key(s).


I performed a objdump on both the proton binary and the libraries that were supplied. 
I noticed a AES128_ECB_decrypt and AES128_ECB_encrypt function

Question 4. Describe the manner in which you actually decrypted the database.
            (note that your method of decryption should actually use the key
            obtained, and thus should not rely on running any function in
            libpassdb).
